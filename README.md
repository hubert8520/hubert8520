- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hubert Grzelka and I am former military member. After 6 years of service, I decided to turn my eyes upon things I was always interested in - computers and technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python as well as bunch of things connected with CCNA exam.
- âœ¨ In my first bigger project I am trying to slowly write my own, simple game in python using pygame.
- ðŸ‘€ My hobbies are fitness, healty nutrition, gaming and of course new technologies.
