- 👋 Hi, I’m Hubert Grzelka and I am former military member. After 6 years of service, I found out that military service is not for me, 
  so I decided to turn my eyes upon things I was always interested in - computers and technology.
- 👀 I’m interested in fitness, healty nutrition and of course new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and bunch of things connected with CCNA exam.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project where I would check and improve my skills as junior python dev.
- 📫 How to reach me?
